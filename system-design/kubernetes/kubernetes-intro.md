# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (k8s) is an open-source **container orchestration** platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling
and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes provides a robust framework for running applications across a
cluster of machines, ensuring high availability, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.

### Why do we need Kubernetes?

Before k8s, managing multiple containers is complex and requires manual effort. K8s solves these challenges by
providing automation, scalability and resilience.

**Reasons for need of kubernetes:**

1. Container Orchestration
2. High Availability & Fault Tolerance
3. Auto-Scaling
4. Load Balancing
5. Service Discovery & Networking
6. Rolling Updates & Rollbacks
7. Resource Optimization
8. Works in Any Environment

### Real-World Use Case

Imagine you are running an e-commerce application with multiple services (user authentication, product catalog, payment
gateway, etc.), each in a container. Kubernetes can:

- Automatically deploy and manage these containers.
- Scale the application during peak sales (e.g., Black Friday Sale).
- Recover from failures without downtime.
- Balance traffic across multiple running instances.
